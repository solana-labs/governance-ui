Since the Metaplex protocol launched last July, creators have used it to mint 5.7 million NFTs with over 600,000 unique wallets holding one. Metaplex’s Candy Machine is responsible for virtually every generative collection in the ecosystem, and its commerce program Auction House is quickly gaining adoption from projects like Fractal that value open protocols, global price discovery, and decentralization."

For every 1 USDH on the market, more than $1 of crypto is deposited into Hubble.\nAll USDH in existence is minted from Hubble Protocol. Users can mint USDH by depositing their crypto assets into Hubble. By depositing collateral, a user enables the minting of USDH, thus bringing more USDH into circulation."

          "3. Hubble Native Yield\nUSDH Vault stakers earn a an adjustable % yield referred to as the Hubble Native Yield (HNY). The HNY can be manually adjusted to increase or decrease rewards, thus increasing or decreasing USDH demand.",
          "4. Liquidity\nBy establishing USDH as a ubiquitous stablecoin across Solana, pairing USDH with numerous tokens across multiple DEXes and attracting liquidity, USDH becames more and more settled at a 1:1 ratio with the USD. The more USDH liquidity grows, the stronger the USDH peg becomes."
