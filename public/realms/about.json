Prior to joining Solana Labs, Stephen held product leadership roles at a variety of technology startups, most recently as a Product Director at Omada Health. Since the Metaplex protocol launched last July, creators have used it to mint 5.7 million NFTs with over 600,000 unique wallets holding one. Metaplex’s Candy Machine is responsible for virtually every generative collection in the ecosystem, and its commerce program Auction House is quickly gaining adoption from projects like Fractal that value open protocols, global price discovery, and decentralization."

For every 1 USDH on the market, more than $1 of crypto is deposited into Hubble.\nAll USDH in existence is minted from Hubble Protocol. Users can mint USDH by depositing their crypto assets into Hubble. By depositing collateral, a user enables the minting of USDH, thus bringing more USDH into circulation."

          "3. Hubble Native Yield\nUSDH Vault stakers earn a an adjustable % yield referred to as the Hubble Native Yield (HNY). The HNY can be manually adjusted to increase or decrease rewards, thus increasing or decreasing USDH demand.",
          "4. Liquidity\nBy establishing USDH as a ubiquitous stablecoin across Solana, pairing USDH with numerous tokens across multiple DEXes and attracting liquidity, USDH becames more and more settled at a 1:1 ratio with the USD. The more USDH liquidity grows, the stronger the USDH peg becomes."

If you want to build a new protocol, you need to lobby for integration, but there are so many protocols on so many blockchains that no one can expect to be included. It’s a product management nightmare, and it’s holding back innovation. Wallets are more like blackberries than they are like iPhones—token specific asset management tools—but imagine a wallet that used all of your crypto assets. Imagine if you could manage your Mango margin accounts, stake your DeGods, or view your Magic Eden listings not in a web view, but natively in a single interface. Imagine if you wanted to create your own token protocol with your own twist without having to convince everyone to implement it. xNFTs are the standard breaking standard making all of this possible. And for the first chapter in this story, we’re building not a wallet, but something different, an xNFT operating system we call Backpack.",

Most wallets only show your tokens. Some don’t even show your precious JPEGs. Backpack, however, is a home for everything. It’s an open, programmable system built for Web3. And like any other application operating system, has a set of developer frameworks and APIs associated with it, allowing anyone to build their own xNFT apps for any protocol on any blockchain—without permission.",

One of the clear benefits of the name service is a human-readable name that maps to a SOL address. Wallet address formats can be a barrier to entry, and therefore having an identifiable address can facilitate payments, efficiency, and overall user experience in our sphere. A name, not a number.",
          "Besides SNS, Bonfida’s contributions to the ecosystem include; (1) creating a new Serum Core engine, the Asset Agnostic Orderbook (AOB), (2) xMS, the cross-messaging service, to name a few.  As a result of these contributions, our developers are highly respected and sought after within the Solana ecosystem."
