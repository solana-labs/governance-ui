Prior to joining Solana Labs, Stephen held product leadership roles at a variety of technology startups, most recently as a Product Director at Omada Health. Since the Metaplex protocol launched last July, creators have used it to mint 5.7 million NFTs with over 600,000 unique wallets holding one. Metaplex’s Candy Machine is responsible for virtually every generative collection in the ecosystem, and its commerce program Auction House is quickly gaining adoption from projects like Fractal that value open protocols, global price discovery, and decentralization."

USDH is fully collateralized by a basket of crypto assets, deposited into a Hubble Smart Contract.\nUSDH is Solana-native, and can be held in any Solana wallet. For every 1 USDH on the market, more than $1 of crypto is deposited into Hubble.\nAll USDH in existence is minted from Hubble Protocol. Users can mint USDH by depositing their crypto assets into Hubble. By depositing collateral, a user enables the minting of USDH, thus bringing more USDH into circulation."

          "2. Stability Fees\nHubble has a Stability Fee, acting as an interest rate, that can be increased if USDH falls below peg. The Stability Fee incentivizes users to repay their loans, which can help reduce USDH supply on the market when necessary.",
          "3. Hubble Native Yield\nUSDH Vault stakers earn a an adjustable % yield referred to as the Hubble Native Yield (HNY). The HNY can be manually adjusted to increase or decrease rewards, thus increasing or decreasing USDH demand.",
          "4. Liquidity\nBy establishing USDH as a ubiquitous stablecoin across Solana, pairing USDH with numerous tokens across multiple DEXes and attracting liquidity, USDH becames more and more settled at a 1:1 ratio with the USD. The more USDH liquidity grows, the stronger the USDH peg becomes."

Code reviews are extremely strict and security audits are performed regularly, with five having been completed thus far.

          "Blockasset athlete tokens are a shared asset controlled by fans and athletes alike. They allow fans direct access to the athlete’s experience with features that incentivize athletes to grow and reward their fanbase.",
          "Blockasset has a number of world-famous athletes on board, including sporting Legends Wayne Rooney, Michael Bisping and Alex Ovechkin all of whom are partners & investors, and superstars like Khamzat Chimaev of the UFC and Heavyweight Boxing Champion Oleksandr Usyk, plus over 30 more athletes that are yet to be announced.",
          "WHAT IS THE BLOCK TOKEN?\nBlockasset allows fans to invest directly into their favourite athletes through the BLOCK token, the main trading pair for all athlete tokens. Additionally, fans can use BLOCK token to access athlete IDOs via the Athlete Launchpad, think DAO Maker or Binance Launchpad, but for Athlete Social Tokens.",
          "HOW DOES IT WORK?\nUsing an intuitive and interactive social platform, seasoned crypto investors and first-timers alike can easily buy, sell and trade athlete tokens, attaching their investments directly to athlete experiences, NFTs, media and governance. BLOCK acts as the gateway to all athlete tokens.",
          "Fans can stake their tokens to access unique perks, including athlete governance voting, exclusive content and bonus rewards when their athlete celebrates a specific victory or milestone in their career. Meaning fans and athletes can mutually benefit from an athlete’s success.",
          "Fans will be able to spend their athlete tokens on the athlete’s own ‘Experience Store’, where fans can purchase priceless experiences and items directly from the athlete, from Facetimes to sporting event watch parties with the athlete and other fans, training videos, signed memorabilia, real-life meetups and so much more. Via the governance system, fans can even vote on what they want to see in the experience store.",
          "When a fan purchases an experience, a percentage goes directly to the athlete, and the remainder is burned, removed from the circulating supply. As a result, the more experiences the athletes offer, and the more fans engage, the more tokens are burned, and with this comes more demand, creating a healthy token economy for all involved.",

Francium's on-chain smart contract will automatically convert half of the deposited USDC into another token (e.g. SOL), then add these tokens to the relevant Dex to get the LP, and then stake the LP to the farming pools. In addition, Auto-compounding is an important way to generate high profits. Francium helps users automatically take out their earnings and reinvest them into relevant positions. This allows profits to be generated quickly, thus maximizing earnings."

If you want to build a new protocol, you need to lobby for integration, but there are so many protocols on so many blockchains that no one can expect to be included. It’s a product management nightmare, and it’s holding back innovation. Wallets are more like blackberries than they are like iPhones—token specific asset management tools—but imagine a wallet that used all of your crypto assets. Imagine if you could manage your Mango margin accounts, stake your DeGods, or view your Magic Eden listings not in a web view, but natively in a single interface. Imagine if you wanted to create your own token protocol with your own twist without having to convince everyone to implement it. xNFTs are the standard breaking standard making all of this possible. And for the first chapter in this story, we’re building not a wallet, but something different, an xNFT operating system we call Backpack.",
          "Like a wallet, Backpack manages your private keys and connects to apps. But unlike anything else, it’s asset and protocol agnostic. Everything in the wallet is an xNFT. This is a big deal. Most wallets only show your tokens. Some don’t even show your precious JPEGs. Backpack, however, is a home for everything. It’s an open, programmable system built for Web3. And like any other application operating system, has a set of developer frameworks and APIs associated with it, allowing anyone to build their own xNFT apps for any protocol on any blockchain—without permission.",

They generally encompasse smart contract risk, stablecoin de-peg risk, slashing risk, oracle failures, economic exploits, etc. Risk of smart contract exploits is particularly significant with over $3B lost to smart contract hacks in 2021. By offering protection against these more common DeFi risk types along with NFT and metaverse-related offerings, users and developers alike can enjoy a safer Web3 through Amulet."

Riding along this wave of explosive growth is a rapidly increasing demand for risk hedging.",
          "Rust-based public chains have been maturing rapidly with growth spearheaded in particular by Solana. According to Amulet's research, TVL on Solana has grown 5x faster than on Ethereum, and this growth is expected to continue given the distinctive strengths of Solana centered around its lower cost and higher throughput.",
          "At the moment, risk management solutions are still relatively scarce or non-existent on Solana and the Rust-based ecosystems at large, presenting Amulet with an incredible and unique market opportunity. Amulet expects major demand for its cover products and other risk management solutions along with Solana's continued growth and adoption."
